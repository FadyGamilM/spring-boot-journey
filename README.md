# spring-boot-journey-
This repo is just a random repo for my journey learning spring boot 3 and spring framework 6

# what is the difference between a spring boot and spring framework ? 
- Spring framework is bunch of framework libraries.
- We can use spring framework without spring boot, but we cannot do the opposite.
- Spring boot is wrapper around spring.
